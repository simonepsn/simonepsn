- I’m currently learning advanced modeling techniques and their applications in financial markets.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving data-driven decision-making and financial analysis.
- Fun fact: I’m a chess enthusiast and enjoy applying strategic thinking both on and off the board.
